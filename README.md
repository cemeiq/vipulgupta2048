### Hello folks, this is Vipul :hatching_chick:

Apart from my love for [party parrots](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/partystarter) and [vanilla](https://mixstersite.wordpress.com), I build for [balena](https://balena.io) and write docs at my initiative, [Mixster](https://bit.ly/whatmixster). I have been around the sun on this blue planet 21 times. I have collectively spent weeks total in layovers, railway stations, and buses backpacking solo since I was 19. I like spicy food, windy weather, and contributing to open-source in all my free time. No, [I don't like 2048](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#about-2048), the game to have that in my username. Yes, I create memes every week at my workplace! I call it `memes "no one asked for" as a service`

I also [write](http://mixstersite.wordpress.com/), [speak](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#talks-with-2048), [design](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#design-by-2048), [attend](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#conferences-with-2048), [participate](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#google-summer-of-code-with-2048) and [organise]() a ton of things on the side over the weekends. Work life balance? Never heard of that and imposter syndrome is a distant relative.
